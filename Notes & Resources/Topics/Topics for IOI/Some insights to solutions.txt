-constructing a solution? try it backwards
-Bits? a+b = a^b + 2*(a&b)
-two segments intersect if max(l1,l2) <= min(r1,r2)
-Union-find updates: can be modeled as a (binary) tree
-Manhattan distances:
dist(p,q) = max( |p.d1 - q.d1| , |p.d2 - q.d2| )   (d1=x+y, d2=x-y)   
-A tree path with certain properties --> centroid decomposition
 Any path --> divide and conquer
