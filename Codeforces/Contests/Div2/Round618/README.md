## Problems

### A. Non-zero
- Rating: 900
- Tags: Greedy, Math
- Approach: Count zeros and convert them to ones, check final sum
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### B. Assigning to Classes
- Rating: 1000
- Tags: Sorting, Greedy
- Approach: Sort students and find difference of middle elements
- Time Complexity: O(N log N)
- Space Complexity: O(N)

## Implementation Notes
- Both solutions use clean OOP approach
- Minimal template usage
- Clear documentation with complexity analysis

## Key Insights
1. Problem A: Two-step process - handle zeros first, then check sum
2. Problem B: Sorting makes finding optimal split straightforward
