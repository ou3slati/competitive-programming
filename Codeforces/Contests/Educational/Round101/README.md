## Problems

### A. Regular Bracket Sequence
- Rating: 800
- Tags: String Analysis, Implementation
- Approach: Check basic conditions for potential regular bracket sequence
- Key Observation: String must be even length, can't start with closing or end with opening bracket

- Space Complexity: O(1)

### B. Red and Blue
- Rating: 1000
- Tags: Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sums
- Approach: Use DP to find maximum possible sum considering both sequences
